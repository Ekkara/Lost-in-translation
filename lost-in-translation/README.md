# Lost in translation

A simple exercise to get started on React and JSX by creating a translator program.

(Fun fact, this is actually Mikael's second ever project that he personally uploaded to Git, following Noroff's tutorial step-by-step, sooo... yay!)

## Installation

Install npm and jsnode (LT) and it should run with console on any modern browser, No guarantees what will happen if you're using IE though (if you can count that as modern).

## Description

This web application provides the user with a translator which converts english letters into hand signs, aimed perhaps towards people with hearing
disabilities or those who simply get bored of vibrating their vocal chords and are looking for other options during office meetings.

## Authors and acknowledgment

Dewaldels for providing an excellent template to build upon.

Sean Skinner, for being a great teacher and speaker, able to drill React and JSX fundamentals into our minds where we had no prior knowledge of any of the topics whatsoever.

Mikael's coffee cup, for being Mikael's coffee cup. (Erik doesn't drink coffee).

Maybe Mikael and Erik had some influence in the production.

## Project Status

All done, again!

Until maybe Sean breaks it this time.

Or, perhaps we are just. That. Good. [Mic drop]
